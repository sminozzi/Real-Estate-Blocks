Real Estate Blocks is a powerful and modern WordPress Block Theme crafted specifically for real estate agencies, realtors, property managers, and property listing websites. Built with Full Site Editing (FSE) at its core, this theme gives you complete visual control over every part of your website—no coding required.

It includes a variety of pre-designed block patterns, making it easy to build professional sections for FAQs, featured property listings, and more. All colors, typography, and layouts can be customized directly in the Site Editor.
